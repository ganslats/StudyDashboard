StudyDashboard
==============

This GitHub repository contains an exported Talend Open Studio(TM) job and 
accompanying SQL statements to implement the Extraction, Transformation 
and Loading pathway of the Clinical Study Dashboard described in the 
publication "Concept and Implementation of a Study Dashboard Module for 
a Continuous Monitoring of Trial Recruitment and Documentation".


Setup
=====

The Talend Open Studio job was created and exported with version 5.6 (64bit)
of the software and can be imported into a local workspace using the Import function.
The accompanying SQL statements were created on an Oracle 11g (TM) database and may
need adaptation to run on other database platforms. The DDL statements can be used
to create the required tables. DML statements are available for filling dimension 
tables with predefinied records, in English or German language.
